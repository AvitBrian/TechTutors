# Manual:
the backend is composed of a flask app that interracts with our database to provide api endpoints. 
to set up the environment, first make sure you're running python3.3 and above. <b>
```
python3 --version
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-venv
```
then create and activate the virtual environment
```
python -m venv myenv
```
on macOS and linux:
```
source myenv/bin/activate
```
on windows:
```
myenv\Scripts\activate
```
all you need to do now is install the dependencies and run the app.py
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py
```

# Docker:
What's that, you're a docker lunatic? <br>
Gorgeous! just build image from the Dockerfile in the root directory:<br>
```
sudo docker build -t python-techtutors .
sudo docker run --name techtutors -p 5000:5000 python-techtutors . 
```
you can add the `-d` flag to run it in detached mode
and everything should be running in the blink of an eye! navigate to the address and have fun.
